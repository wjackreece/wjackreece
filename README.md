:nerd_face: Hello, curious minds and digital explorers! I'm thrilled to embark on an exciting journey, transitioning from a dynamic role in education to the ever-evolving world of tech.

📚 As a former educator, I've mastered the art of shaping minds and fostering growth. Now, I'm translating that passion into crafting seamless digital experiences.

🌐 Projects like [UFMBC](https://ufmbc.org) and [ReWork](https://reworkbywj.com) showcase my fusion of skills. My coding journey centers around JavaScript and using power of frameworks like React to bring my ideas to life.

🎯 Guiding others to unlock tech's potential is my passion. As an advocate, I'm driven to make tech accessible and engaging. I'm not just coding; I'm building bridges between dreams and reality.
