# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Transforming from a science educator to a tech enthusiast, I'm weaving my skills into the digital realm. Projects like [UFMBC](https://ufmbc.org) and [ReWork](https://reworkbywj.com) are my canvas, where I blend JavaScript finesse and React mastery for immersive experiences.

### As an advocate, I'm driven to make tech accessible and engaging. Science classrooms were my platform, now websites are my canvas, painted with code.

### Dive into my journey at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wynstona-jackreece/) and let's craft a future where technology empowers and connects. 

## Guiding others to unlock tech's potential is my passion. 

## Let's strive for progress together.
